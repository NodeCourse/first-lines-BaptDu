This is a pretty simple Node.js exercise, the goal is to:

1. Test your Node.js installation
2. Setup Git practices (branches & pull requests)
3. Get a first feeling of Node.js

## Instructions

Create a program that writes the current time stamp to a file every second.
You have succeeded if the end file looks like:

```
1526136935103
1526136936103
1526136937102
```

You will need to use Node.js' [fs](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) module, the [Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) object and a way to call a function every second.

## Step by step

1. Get a copy of this repository [x]
2. Clone it on your computer [x]
3. Create a new branch for your work [x]
4. Initialize a new Node.js project [x]
5. Create an index.js file to write your code [x]
6. Run your program and check the result 
7. Commit and push your changes
8. Visit your GitHub repository to create a pull request
